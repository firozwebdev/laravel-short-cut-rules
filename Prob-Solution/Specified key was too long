problem:: 

[Illuminate\Database\QueryException]
SQLSTATE[42000]: Syntax error or access violation: 1071 Specified key was too long; max key length is 767 bytes


Solution: 

As outlined in the Migrations guide to fix this all you have to do is 
edit your AppServiceProvider.php file and inside the boot method set a default string length:

code: 

use Illuminate\Support\Facades\Schema;

public function boot()
{
    Schema::defaultStringLength(191);
}
